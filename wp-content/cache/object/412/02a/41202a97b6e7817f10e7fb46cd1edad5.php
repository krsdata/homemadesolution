Whether it is to reach their fitness goal by shedding the extra pounds or to maintain their ideal weight, diet plans are gaining popularity in a huge way amongst celebrities and commoners alike. A high-protein and low-carb diet is one such popular diet plan that not only aids weight loss but also provides your body with essential energy-giving nutrients while satiating your appetite.
<h2>Examples Of High-Protein Low-Carb Foods</h2>
The best part about this diet plan is that it is sure to consist of some of your favorite food varieties that you neednâ€™t refrain from. Here are some of the most popular foods that are low in carbs and high in protein:
<h3>1. Meat And Fish:</h3>
All you meat lovers â€“ rejoice! Hereâ€™s a diet plan that promotes the consumption of many protein-packed meat and fish varieties. These include turkey and chicken breast, lamb, steak, ham, veal, pork tenderloin, minced beef, prawns, shrimps, crab, tuna, salmon, etc. Though you must limit your intake of meat rich in saturated fats such as pork, lamb and beef, you can enjoy one portion of fish, white meat, as well as lean meat every day. They provide a good dose of protein while also protecting you from the dangers of saturated fats â€“ like heart diseases.
<h3>2. Nuts And Seeds:</h3>
Looking for a healthy snack to fight those hunger pangs? Youâ€™ll be happy to know that your go-to fillers are excellent protein powerhouses! Almonds, walnuts, pistachios, pumpkin, flax and sunflower seeds are rich in protein and can be eaten straight as snacks or can be used to top salads and smoothies. Just ensure that you keep the portion sizes of these nuts and seeds small as they are high in fats (the good fats).[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_widget_sidebar sidebar_id="healthy_nutrition___food_sidebar"][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"5 Amazing Benefits Of High Protein Low Carb Diet";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:48:"5-amazing-benefits-of-high-protein-low-carb-diet";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-04-20 12:06:40";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-04-20 12:06:40";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:41:"http://localhost/homemadesolutions/?p=597";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
