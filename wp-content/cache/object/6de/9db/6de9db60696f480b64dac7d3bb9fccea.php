<h3 id="WhatIsTheMeaningOfOm&amp;Aum?">What Is The Meaning Of Om &amp; Aum?</h3>
They say that before the world began, Brahma ‚Äì the creator, the absolute reality ‚Äì was one, and He said, ‚ÄúI am one, but may I become many?‚Äù This thought created a vibration that settled into a sound. This sound was Om. The creation of the world began with this vibration ‚Äì Om.

When you chant Om, the vibration from that sound correlates to the original vibrations that were sounded in the universe when the world was created. The sound of Om is often called Pranava, or that which runs through breath (Prana) and sustains life. Om is also a representation of the four states of the Supreme Being.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_widget_sidebar sidebar_id="healthy_nutrition___food_sidebar"][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:47:"The Meaning Of The OM Symbol ‚Äì How To Use It?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:42:"the-meaning-of-the-om-symbol-how-to-use-it";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-04-20 12:05:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-04-20 12:05:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:41:"http://localhost/homemadesolutions/?p=604";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"1";}}
