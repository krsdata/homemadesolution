If yes, there is good news for you! We have an amazing diet plan for you that doesnâ€™t require you to go on a hunger strike!

Eat your way to losing up to 20 pounds in 28 days by following the Fast Metabolism Diet. Eating the right foods will keep your metabolism active and support your digestive system, thereby helping you to burn more fat than you would burn when you eat fewer calories.

The plan requires you to follow three phases over a period of 7 days. It allows you to eat specific foods in each phase, which boosts your metabolism. You have to repeat the phases for 3 more weeks to get optimum results.

The fast metabolism diet plan for weight loss was developed by food coach Hailey Pomroy, the author of the New York Times Bestseller, The Fast Metabolism Diet. Hailey Pomroy strongly supports the idea that people canÂ <strong>lose weight by eating more food at an interval of 1-2 hours</strong>.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_widget_sidebar sidebar_id="healthy_nutrition___food_sidebar"][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:65:"Fast Metabolism Diet Review (With Recipes For Phases 1, 2, And 3)";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:61:"fast-metabolism-diet-review-with-recipes-for-phases-1-2-and-3";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-04-20 12:08:17";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-04-20 12:08:17";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:41:"http://localhost/homemadesolutions/?p=576";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
