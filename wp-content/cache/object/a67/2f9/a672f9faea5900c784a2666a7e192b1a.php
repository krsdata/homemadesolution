It is by using hydrogen peroxide. Wondering how that can help you remove your blackheads? Then read this post!
<h2>Blackheads ‚Äì An Overview:</h2>
Blackheads are a form of acne¬†that is caused when the oil clogged in your pores gets oxidized, and your skin becomes brownish or blackish in color. The so-called blackhead removal products that you find in the market do not work as they promise to. What you need is a home remedy that effectively helps you remove blackheads and gives you great-looking skin. One such remedy is hydrogen peroxide.
<h2>How To Use Hydrogen Peroxide To Remove Blackheads:</h2>
Using a hydrogen peroxide treatment to remove blackheads is simple. All you need to do is:
<ol>
 	<li>Wash your face with a mild cleanser to remove any excess oil, bacteria and other impurities from your skin. Wash off with water and pat dry.</li>
 	<li>Next, exfoliate the areas of your skin that are affected by blackheads. You can use a homemade face scrub that is a paste made with sugar and water. It will be mildly abrasive to help in removing the oxidized blackhead surfaces. Rinse thoroughly.</li>
 	<li>Now it is time for the hydrogen peroxide treatment <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1123998/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(2)</a>. Moisten a cotton ball with 3% hydrogen peroxide and gently dab your blackheads with it. Make sure that you avoid your eyebrows and hairline as it will bleach your hair.</li>
 	<li>Moisturize your skin with jojoba, avocado or olive oil while it is still damp. Massage 1 teaspoon of the oil on your face. It will act as an emollient that smoothens and protects your skin by retaining moisture.</li>
</ol>
