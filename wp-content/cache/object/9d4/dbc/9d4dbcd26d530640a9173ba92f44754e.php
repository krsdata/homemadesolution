Human beings spend 33% of their lives sleeping, and if this activity were to decide the quality of life in the modern world, the quality index would be dismal indeed!

Tremendous amounts of stress and anxiety riddle our lives apart from the multitudinous physical ailments that torment us in our hectic lifestyles. This leads to very poor quality of sleep or sleep deprivation altogether, and most of us end up getting much less than the required eight hours of sleep every night.

<em>Women are especially affected by the lack of sleep</em>, as recent scientific studies show that they need to rest more than their male counterparts â€“ at least 20 more minutes, according to Britainâ€™s leading sleep expert, Professor Jim Horne, who is also the Director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, UK
